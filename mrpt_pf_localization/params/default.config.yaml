# This file defines parameters to configure the settings of the class
# PFLocalizationCore inside the ROS 2 package mrpt_pf_localization.
# Refer to the package README.md and the comments below for the meaning of each
# parameter.
#
# The two top-level entries are there so we can use this file as a ROS 2
# parameter YAML file, but it can be also used directly to feed the internal
# PFLocalizationCore class skipping those two top-level YAML maps, as done
# in the unit tests (see "test/*.cpp")
